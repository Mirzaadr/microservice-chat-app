## Chat app Microservice
Based on this [article](https://dev.to/davydocsurg/mastering-microservices-a-hands-on-tutorial-with-nodejs-rabbitmq-nginx-and-docker-m4f).

The aim of this project is to build a real-time chat server using a microservices architecture. The key requirements include:
- Real-Time Communication: The chat server should facilitate instant messaging between users, ensuring a seamless real-time experience.
- Scalability: The architecture should support easy scaling of individual components to accommodate a growing user base without affecting the entire system.
- Modularity: We want our system to be modular, allowing us to update, deploy, and scale each microservice independently.
